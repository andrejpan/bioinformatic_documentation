Splitting multi fasta file
==========================

For example if you have [amilaze_multi.fasta](amilaze_multi.fasta) and you want to have separate [*.fasta](bioinformatic_documentation/tree/master/amilaze_aa) files.

Use:
$ python split.py amilaze_multi.fasta

and you will get separate files like they are in amilaze_aa folder
