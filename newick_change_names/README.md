Change all sequence names inside newick tree generated by Mega6
===============================================================

python requirements:
* biopthon
* xlrd: http://www.python-excel.org/
* matplotlib: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib

When you have sequences and you want to make phylogenetic tree you often have problems. For instance sequence name can start with something like this:

>gi|296270111|ref|YP_003652743.1| family 10 glycoside hydrolase [Thermobispora bispora DSM 43833]

and brach inside newick tree with this sequence will only show you first half of name which can be problematic for making final evaluation.

To change names you need spreadsheet(example ksilinaze.xls) where first column has original fasta names and second has more "friendly" names. Socond column you need to do it manualy :)

Use: python change_names_newick.py your_tree.nwk spreadsheet.xls

# make sure that your sequence names does not have ",", ":", "(", ")", "'" characters

Some times there are branch lengths written with "," instead of ".", please save newick tree once again with Mega6

You can also test your new generated tree with this:

python test_newick_tree.py your_new_tree.nwk
